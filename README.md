# React + TypeScript + Vite

We're using bun with Vite and React to create a simple web app.

This app allows you to have a teleprompter app that listens to your voice scroll to the right location. It uses webkit speech recognition to listen to your voice and scroll the text accordingly.

## Demo

You can view a live demo of the app on GitHub Pages: [https://desduvauchelle.github.io/teleprompter]https://desduvauchelle.github.io/teleprompter)

## Getting Started

To get started, you can either clone the repository.


## Setup

First, ensure you have [Bun](https://bun.sh/) installed. If not, you can install it by running:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

Then, install the dependencies and start the development server:

```bash
bun install
bun run dev
```

Your app should now be running on [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

## Build

To build the app, run:

```bash
bun run build
```

This will create an optimized build of your app in the `dist` directory.
